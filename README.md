# Katakana recognition

A learning project in computer vision: exploring handwritten Katakana from ETL1 and building a character classifier step by step.

## Dataset overview

The current selection contains **67,726 grayscale images**, **48 characters**, and **1,411 writers**. Images are 64 pixels wide by 63 pixels high. One acquisition group is retained for each repeated character; historical `ヰ` and `ヱ` remain included.

## Current progress

- Image exploration and class-count inspection.
- Metadata loading and acquisition-group selection.
- Writer identifiers recovered from the original binary records.
- Reproducible training, validation, and test split with no shared writers.
- Shared integer labels for the 48 characters.
- TensorFlow input pipeline: grayscale decoding, normalization, batching, and prefetching. Only training data is shuffled.

Model training and evaluation have not yet been implemented in this repository. No performance results are reported at this stage.
